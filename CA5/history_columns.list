! the following lines of the log file contain info about 1 model per row

   ! some general info about the model

      model_number ! counting from the start of the run
      star_age ! elapsed simulated time in years since the start of the run
      star_mass ! in Msun units

   ! conditions at the photosphere
      log_Teff ! log10 effective temperature

   ! conditions at or near the surface of the model (outer edge of outer cell)

      log_L ! log10 luminosity in Lsun units
      log_R ! log10 radius in Rsun units

   ! conditions near center

      log_center_T ! temperature
